### ðŸ’¡ About the Project:

This repo is a recreation of the famous iPhone calculagor UI and functionality using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript + a working clock in the iPhone's status bar

 Since I'm a fan of the iPhone's design language, my goal for this project was to create a replica of the iPhone calculator UI and functionality.
